## Aboout the project
This is my first big project in web development.I worked on this as a final project while on Tech Talent Accelerator.A programme organized by Generation Uk. The programming skills I acquired covered the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also learn't Algorithm Design and Problem Solving, Terminal Fundamentals, Source Control Using Git, DOM, frame work eg bootstrap. I chose to work on this project because it consists of everything I have learn't during the six weeks of the programme. This project is about collecting real time Covid 19 statistics and ploting the stats on HTML canvas as charts.



## Process
The process begins by preparing an HTML canvas and fetching data using from an API provided by rapid API. The data obtained is the processed and stored in variables. Charts are the created and embedded on the canvas using charts.js library.
